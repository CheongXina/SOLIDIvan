# SOLID-principles-explained 2221 Ivan

I chose OCP because I am very experienced with this due to working in Unreal Engine without the engine source code (You are unable to modify the Engine core without the engine source code.)

I chose LSP because that's a common principle to consider when refactoring code without having lots of things breaking during the refactoring process.

I chose SRP because it is defining trait of OOP clean code and that is most of what we're learning in class instead of functional/data oriented programming which tends to avoid abstractions for performance. 

I've commented my code inside the code, or I added a readme.txt in the Solved and Violation for examples where commenting inside the code (class code, since you can't declare than one class in a single java file) was not as easy to understand when I had to explain what I'm doing between classes.
